## Ledger Microservice
# Overview
The Ledger microservice is designed to serve as the source of truth for balances of assets and liabilities of an entity. It allows clients to manage multi-asset accounts, perform asset movements, track account and movement lifecycles, and retrieve historical balance data. Built with the latest Java and Spring Boot technologies, the Ledger microservice provides both synchronous and asynchronous communication capabilities to its clients.

# Features
Multi-Asset Account Management: Supports creation and management of accounts with multiple wallets representing various assets.
Asset Movements: Allows clients to move assets between wallets within an account.
Transaction Consistency: Guarantees "all or nothing" execution for asset movement requests.
Account Lifecycle Management: Facilitates account state transitions such as OPEN and CLOSED.
Posting Lifecycle Management: Supports various posting states like PENDING, CLEARED, and FAILED.
Balance Change Broadcasting: Broadcasts balance changes and movements to clients for real-time updates.
Asynchronous Communication: Enables clients to make movement requests in asynchronous mode.
Historical Data Retrieval: Provides clients with historical balance data for specific wallets at given timestamps.
Scalable Database Design: Utilizes CQRS pattern for efficient handling of write-heavy operations.
